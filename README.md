First I tought the out put of the test was going to be to creat a message, but now I understand its only to be abel to press the (press me) button.


I created a HTML file to the for the user to see the content of the webpage.
I installed yarn, superstatic and cypress to be abel to test and find my webpage.
I created the fil app.js to conect with my HTML fil, and created a UserCan file to run my test.
